# Current Project

## Generating state and zip code files for All the Places


See our example of [pulling and uncompressing the places file](https://github.com/modelearth/places-data) into a repo using a Github Action.

We'll generate .csv files containing place rows for states and then zip codes.
We'll also generate downloadable SQLite files for searches in browsers.

Each state file will be about 5 to 20 MB (since the source file is 383.4 MB).

The Github Action will run daily.
